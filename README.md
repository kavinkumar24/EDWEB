# Edweb
• This project involves the development of a website that serves as an educational platform, providing a wide range of resources and materials for both students and teachers. The website aims to enhance the learning experience by offering study guides, tutorials, interactive quizzes, and downloadable resources.

• The website is built using the React framework, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. This choice of technology ensures a responsive and interactive user experience, making it easy for users to navigate and access the educational content available.
For students, the website offers study guides that cover various subjects and topics, helping them to better understand and grasp the material. These study guides are designed to be comprehensive yet concise, making it easier for students to review and retain important information.

• This educational resources website, built with React, offers a comprehensive platform for students and teachers. It features interactive quizzes, educational videos, and a wide range of study materials. Users can personalize their learning experience, track their progress, and engage with a community of learners and educators. With a user-friendly interface and seamless navigation, our website provides a responsive design across devices.
